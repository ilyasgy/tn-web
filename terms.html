    </p>

    <h3>2. Authorization to Test</h3>
    <p class="muted">
      By purchasing a service, you confirm that you are the owner of the website or have explicit authorization from the owner to request a security assessment.
      You grant ThreatNest permission to perform a non-intrusive security assessment within the agreed scope.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Scope &amp; Restrictions</h3>
    <p class="muted">
      Assessments are limited to the domain(s) provided by the client and the agreed scope. The following activities are not included unless explicitly agreed in writing:

    <ul class="muted list-alpha">
      <li>to verify orders and clarify scope;</li>
      <li>to deliver reports, updates, and support related to the service;</li>
      <li>to improve internal quality and reporting templates without exposing private client details.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">
      Information may be disclosed if required by law, court order, or lawful requests from authorities.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Fees &amp; Payments</h3>

    <h3>9. Refund Policy</h3>
